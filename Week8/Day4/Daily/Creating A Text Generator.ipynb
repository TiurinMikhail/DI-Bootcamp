of sitting by her sister on the\\r', 'bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into\\r', 'the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or\\r', 'conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice\\r', '“without pictures or conversations', '”\\r', '\\r', 'So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\\r', 'hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of\\r', 'making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\\r', 'picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\\r', 'close by her', '\\r', '\\r', 'There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it\\r', 'so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh\\r', 'dear', ' Oh dear', ' I shall be late', '” (when she thought it over afterwards,\\r', 'it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the\\r', 'time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a\\r', 'watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried\\r', 'on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she\\r', 'had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a\\r', 'watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\\r', 'field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a\\r', 'large rabbit-hole under the hedge', '\\r', '\\r', 'In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\\r', 'in the world she was to get out again', '\\r', '\\r', 'The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\\r', 'dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\\r', 'about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very\\r', 'deep well', '\\r', '\\r', 'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\\r', 'plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what\\r', 'was going to happen next', ' First, she tried to look down and make out\\r', 'what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\\r', 'looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\\r', 'cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\\r', 'hung upon pegs', ' She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\\r', 'passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great\\r', 'disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\\r', 'of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\\r', 'cupboards as she fell past it', '\\r', '\\r', '“Well', '” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall\\r', 'think nothing of tumbling down stairs', ' How brave they’ll all think me\\r', 'at home', ' Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the\\r', 'top of the house', '” (Which was very likely true', ')\\r', '\\r', 'Down, down, down', ' Would the fall _never_ come to an end', ' “I wonder how\\r', 'many miles I’ve fallen by this time', '” she said aloud', ' “I must be\\r', 'getting somewhere near the centre of the earth', ' Let me see: that would\\r', 'be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt\\r', 'several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\\r', 'though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\\r', 'knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\\r', 'practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but\\r', 'then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to', '” (Alice had no\\r', 'idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\\r', 'grand words to say', ')\\r', '\\r', 'Presently she began again', ' “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\\r', 'the earth', ' How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk\\r', 'with their heads downward', ' The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather\\r', 'glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all\\r', 'the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\\r', 'country is, you know', ' Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia', '”\\r', '(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy _curtseying_ as you’re\\r', 'falling through the air', ' Do you think you could manage it', ') “And what\\r', 'an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking', ' No, it’ll never do\\r', 'to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere', '”\\r', '\\r', 'Down, down, down', ' There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\\r', 'talking again', ' “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think', '”\\r', '(Dinah was the cat', ') “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\\r', 'tea-time', ' Dinah my dear', ' I wish you were down here with me', ' There are\\r', 'no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s\\r', 'very like a mouse, you know', ' But do cats eat bats, I wonder', '” And here\\r', 'Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\\r', 'dreamy sort of way, “Do cats eat bats', ' Do cats eat bats', '” and\\r', 'sometimes, “Do bats eat cats', '” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer\\r', 'either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it', ' She felt\\r', 'that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\\r', 'walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\\r', '“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat', '” when suddenly,\\r', 'thump', ' thump', ' down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\\r', 'the fall was over', '\\r', '\\r', 'Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\\r', 'she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\\r', 'long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down\\r', 'it', ' There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind,\\r', 'and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears\\r', 'and whiskers, how late it’s getting', '” She was close behind it when she\\r', 'turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\\r', 'herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\\r', 'from the roof', '\\r', '\\r', 'There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\\r', 'Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\\r', 'door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\\r', 'get out again', '\\r', '\\r', 'Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\\r', 'glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\\r', 'first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\\r', 'but, alas', ' either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\\r', 'but at any rate it would not open any of them', ' However, on the second\\r', 'time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\\r', 'behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\\r', 'little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted', '\\r', '\\r', 'Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\\r', 'much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the\\r', 'passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw', ' How she longed to get\\r', 'out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright\\r', 'flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head\\r', 'through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought\\r', 'poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders', ' Oh,\\r', 'how I wish I could shut up like a telescope', ' I think I could, if I only\\r', 'knew how to begin', '” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had\\r', 'happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things\\r', 'indeed were really impossible', '\\r', '\\r', 'There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\\r', 'back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\\r', 'any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\\r', 'time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here\\r', 'before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\\r', 'label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large\\r', 'letters', '\\r', '\\r', 'It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was\\r', 'not going to do _that_ in a hurry', ' “No, I’ll look first,” she said,\\r', '“and see whether it’s marked ‘_poison_’ or not”; for she had read\\r', 'several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and\\r', 'eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they\\r', '_would_ not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them:\\r', 'such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long;\\r', 'and that if you cut your finger _very_ deeply with a knife, it usually\\r', 'bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a\\r', 'bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you,\\r', 'sooner or later', '\\r', '\\r', 'However, this bottle was _not_ marked “poison,” so Alice ventured to\\r', 'taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed\\r', 'flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and\\r', 'hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off', '\\r', '\\r', '*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r', '\\r', '    *      *      *      *      *      *\\r', '\\r', '*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r', '\\r', '\\r', '“What a curious feeling', '” said Alice; “I must be shutting up like a\\r', 'telescope', '”\\r', '\\r', 'And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\\r', 'brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\\r', 'through the little door into that lovely garden', ' First, however, she\\r', 'waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\\r', 'she felt a little nervous about this; “for it might end, you know,”\\r', 'said Alice to herself, “in my going out altogether, like a candle', ' I\\r', 'wonder what I should be like then', '” And she tried to fancy what the\\r', 'flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could\\r', 'not remember ever having seen such a thing', '\\r', '\\r', 'After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\\r', 'into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice', ' when she got to the\\r', 'door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\\r', 'went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\\r', 'it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\\r', 'best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\\r', 'and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\\r', 'sat down and cried', '\\r', '\\r', '“Come, there’s no use in crying like that', '” said Alice to herself,\\r', 'rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute', '” She generally\\r', 'gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\\r', 'and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\\r', 'her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\\r', 'cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\\r', 'for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people', '\\r', '“But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two\\r', 'people', ' Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make _one_ respectable\\r', 'person', '”\\r', '\\r', 'Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\\r', 'she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\\r', '“EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants', ' “Well, I’ll eat it,” said\\r', 'Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\\r', 'makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\\r', 'get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens', '”\\r', '\\r', 'She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way', ' Which\\r', 'way', '”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\\r', 'growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\\r', 'size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\\r', 'had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\\r', 'things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go\\r', 'on in the common way', '\\r', '\\r', 'So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake', '\\r', '\\r', '*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r', '\\r', '    *      *      *      *      *      *\\r', '\\r', '*      *      *      *      *      *      *\\r', '\\r', '\\r', '\\r', '\\r', 'CHAPTER II', '\\r', 'The Pool of Tears\\r', '\\r', '\\r', '“Curiouser and curiouser', '” cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that\\r', 'for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); “now I’m\\r', 'opening out like the largest telescope that ever was', ' Good-bye, feet', '”\\r', '(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\\r', 'sight, they were getting so far off)', ' “Oh, my poor little feet, I\\r', 'wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears', ' I’m\\r', 'sure _I_ shan’t be able', ' I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble\\r', 'myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but I must be\\r', 'kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’t walk the way I\\r', 'want to go', ' Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of boots every\\r', 'Christmas', '”\\r', '\\r', 'And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it', ' “They must\\r', 'go by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem, sending\\r', 'presents to one’s own feet', ' And how odd the directions will look', '\\r', '\\r', '     _Alice’s Right Foot, Esq', ', Hearthrug, near the Fender,_ (_with\\r', '     Alice’s love_)', '\\r', '\\r', 'Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking', '”\\r', '\\r', 'Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\\r', 'now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden\\r', 'key and hurried off to the garden door', '\\r', '\\r', 'Poor Alice', ' It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\\r', 'look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more\\r', 'hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again', '\\r', '\\r', '“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a great girl like\\r', 'you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in this way', ' Stop\\r', 'this moment, I tell you', '” But she went on all the same, shedding\\r', 'gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about\\r', 'four inches deep and reaching half down the hall', '\\r', '\\r', 'After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and\\r', 'she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming', ' It was the White\\r', 'Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves\\r', 'in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a\\r', 'great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, “Oh', ' the Duchess, the\\r', 'Duchess', ' Oh', ' won’t she be savage if I’ve kept her waiting', '” Alice felt\\r', 'so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the\\r', 'Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, “If you please,\\r', 'sir—” The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and\\r', 'the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go', '\\r', '\\r', 'Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she\\r', 'kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear', ' How\\r', 'queer everything is to-day', ' And yesterday things went on just as usual', '\\r', 'I wonder if I’ve been changed in the night', ' Let me think: was I the\\r', 'same when I got up this morning', ' I almost think I can remember feeling\\r', 'a little different', ' But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who\\r', 'in the world am I', ' Ah, _that’s_ the great puzzle', '” And she began\\r', 'thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\\r', 'herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them', '\\r', '\\r', '“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hair goes in such long\\r', 'ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; and I’m sure I can’t\\r', 'be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh', ' she knows such a\\r', 'very little', ' Besides, _she’s_ she, and _I’m_ I, and—oh dear, how\\r', 'puzzling it all is', ' I’ll try if I know all the things I used to know', '\\r', 'Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\\r', 'and four times seven is—oh dear', ' I shall never get to twenty at that\\r', 'rate', ' However, the Multiplication Table doesn’t signify: let’s try\\r', 'Geography', ' London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\\r', 'Rome, and Rome—no, _that’s_ all wrong, I’m certain', ' I must have been\\r', 'changed for Mabel', ' I’ll try and say ‘_How doth the little_—’” and she\\r', 'crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\\r', 'to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\\r', 'did not come the same as they used to do:—\\r', '\\r', '“How doth the little crocodile\\r', '    Improve his shining tail,\\r', 'And pour the waters of the Nile\\r', '    On every golden scale', '\\r', '\\r', '“How cheerfully he seems to grin,\\r', '    How neatly spread his claws,\\r', 'And welcome little fishes in\\r', '    With gently smiling jaws', '”\\r', '\\r', '\\r', '“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice, and her eyes\\r', 'filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabel after all, and\\r', 'I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\\r', 'no toys to play with, and oh', ' ever so many lessons to learn', ' No, I’ve\\r', 'made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay down here', ' It’ll be\\r', 'no use their putting their heads down and saying ‘Come up again, dear', '’\\r', 'I shall only look up and say ‘Who am I then', ' Tell me that first, and\\r', 'then, if I like being that person, I’ll come up: if not, I’ll stay down\\r', 'here till I’m somebody else’—but, oh dear', '” cried Alice, with a sudden\\r', 'burst of tears, “I do wish they _would_ put their heads down', ' I am so\\r', '_very_ tired of being all alone here', '”\\r', '\\r', 'As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\\r', 'that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\\r', 'she was talking', ' “How _can_ I have done that', '” she thought', ' “I must be\\r', 'growing small again', '” She got up and went to the table to measure\\r', 'herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was\\r', 'now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon\\r', 'found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she\\r', 'dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether', '\\r', '\\r', '“That _was_ a narrow escape', '” said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\\r', 'sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; “and\\r', 'now for the garden', '” and she ran with all speed back to the little\\r', 'door: but, alas', ' the little door was shut again, and the little golden\\r', 'key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things are worse than\\r', 'ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so small as this\\r', 'before, never', ' And I declare it’s too bad, that it is', '”\\r', '\\r', 'As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment,\\r', 'splash', ' she was up to her chin in salt water', ' Her first idea was that\\r', 'she had somehow fallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by\\r', 'railway,” she said to herself', ' (Alice had been to the seaside once in\\r', 'her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\\r', 'to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\\r', 'sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\\r', 'of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station', ') However, she\\r', 'soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when\\r', 'she was nine feet high', '\\r', '\\r', '“I wish I hadn’t cried so much', '” said Alice, as she swam about, trying\\r', 'to find her way out', ' “I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\\r', 'being drowned in my own tears', ' That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\\r', 'sure', ' However, everything is queer to-day', '”\\r', '\\r', 'Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\\r', 'off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\\r', 'it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\\r', 'she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\\r', 'slipped in like herself', '\\r', '\\r', '“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak to this mouse', '\\r', 'Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\\r', 'likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying', '” So she\\r', 'began: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool', ' I am very tired\\r', 'of swimming about here, O Mouse', '” (Alice thought this must be the right\\r', 'way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\\r', 'she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “A mouse—of\\r', 'a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse', '”) The Mouse looked at her rather\\r', 'inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\\r', 'but it said nothing', '\\r', '\\r', '“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice; “I daresay it’s\\r', 'a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror', '” (For, with all\\r', 'her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\\r', 'anything had happened', ') So she began again: “Où est ma chatte', '” which\\r', 'was the first sentence in her French lesson-book', ' The Mouse gave a\\r', 'sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\\r', 'fright', ' “Oh, I beg your pardon', '” cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\\r', 'had hurt the poor animal’s feelings', ' “I quite forgot you didn’t like\\r', 'cats', '”\\r', '\\r', '“Not like cats', '” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice', ' “Would\\r', '_you_ like cats if you were me', '”\\r', '\\r', '“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone: “don’t be angry\\r', 'about it', ' And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\\r', 'take a fancy to cats if you could only see her', ' She is such a dear\\r', 'quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\\r', 'in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\\r', 'paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thing to\\r', 'nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, I beg your\\r', 'pardon', '” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\\r', 'over, and she felt certain it must be really offended', ' “We won’t talk\\r', 'about her any more if you’d rather not', '”\\r', '\\r', '“We indeed', '” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\\r', 'tail', ' “As if _I_ would talk on such a subject', ' Our family always\\r', '_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things', ' Don’t let me hear the name\\r', 'again', '”\\r', '\\r', '“I won’t indeed', '” said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\\r', 'conversation', ' “Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs', '” The Mouse did not\\r', 'answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “There is such a nice little dog near\\r', 'our house I should like to show you', ' A little bright-eyed terrier, you\\r', 'know, with oh, such long curly brown hair', ' And it’ll fetch things when\\r', 'you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\\r', 'of things—I can’t remember half of them—and it belongs to a farmer, you\\r', 'know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds', ' He says\\r', 'it kills all the rats and—oh dear', '” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\\r', '“I’m afraid I’ve offended it again', '” For the Mouse was swimming away\\r', 'from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\\r', 'pool as it went', '\\r', '\\r', 'So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear', ' Do come back again, and we\\r', 'won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them', '” When the\\r', 'Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\\r', 'was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\\r', 'trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\\r', 'history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs', '”\\r', '\\r', 'It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\\r', 'birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a\\r', 'Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures', ' Alice\\r', 'led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore', '\\r', '\\r', '\\r', '\\r', '\\r', 'CHAPTER III',

wonder', '” Alice guessed in a\\r', 'moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid\\r', 'gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but\\r', 'they were nowhere to be seen—everything seemed to have changed since\\r', 'her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the\\r', 'little door, had vanished completely', '\\r', '\\r', 'Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\\r', 'called out to her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what _are_ you\\r', 'doing out here', ' Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and\\r', 'a fan', ' Quick, now', '” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off\\r', 'at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the\\r', 'mistake it had made', '\\r', '\\r', '“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran', ' “How\\r', 'surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am', ' But I’d better take him\\r', 'his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them', '” As she said this, she\\r', 'came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\\r', 'plate with the name “W', ' RABBIT,” engraved upon it', ' She went in without\\r', 'knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\\r', 'real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\\r', 'fan and gloves', '\\r', '\\r', '“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be going messages for\\r', 'a rabbit', ' I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next', '” And she\\r', 'began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: “‘Miss Alice', ' Come\\r', 'here directly, and get ready for your walk', '’ ‘Coming in a minute,\\r', 'nurse', ' But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out', '’ Only I\\r', 'don’t think,” Alice went on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house\\r', 'if it began ordering people about like that', '”\\r', '\\r', 'By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\\r', 'in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three\\r', 'pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the\\r', 'gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a\\r', 'little bottle that stood near the looking-glass', ' There was no label\\r', 'this time with the words “DRINK ME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it\\r', 'and put it to her lips', ' “I know _something_ interesting is sure to\\r', 'happen,” she said to herself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so\\r', 'I’ll just see what this bottle does', ' I do hope it’ll make me grow large\\r', 'again, for really I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing', '”\\r', '\\r', 'It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\\r', 'drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\\r', 'and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken', ' She hastily put\\r', 'down the bottle, saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’t\\r', 'grow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wish I hadn’t\\r', 'drunk quite so much', '”\\r', '\\r', 'Alas', ' it was too late to wish that', '

elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head', '\\r', 'Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\\r', 'of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself “Now I\\r', 'can do no more, whatever happens', ' What _will_ become of me', '”\\r', '\\r', 'Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\\r', 'and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\\r', 'seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\\r', 'again, no wonder she felt unhappy', '\\r', '\\r', '“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “when one wasn’t\\r', 'always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\\r', 'rabbits', ' I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that

moment she appeared on the\\r', 'other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\\r', 'over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\\r', 'very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\\r', 'moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\\r', 'the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\\r', 'little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\\r', 'all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\\r', 'its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut', '\\r', '\\r', 'This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\\r', 'set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of

followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\\r', 'the King’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\\r', 'grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS', '\\r', '\\r', 'Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\\r', 'like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\\r', 'of such a rule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of a\\r', 'procession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon their\\r', 'faces, so that they couldn’t see it', '” So she stood still where she was,\\r', 'and waited', '\\r', '\\r', 'When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\\r', 'at her, and the Queen said severely “Who is this', '” She said it to the\\r', 'Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and

_these', '_” said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\\r', 'who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\\r', 'their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\\r', 'the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\\r', 'or courtiers, or three of her own children', '\\r', '\\r', '“How should _I_ know', '” said Alice, surprised at her own courage', ' “It’s\\r', 'no business of _mine_', '”\\r', '\\r', 'The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\\r', 'moment like a wild beast, screamed “Off with her head', ' Off—”\\r', '\\r', '“Nonsense', '” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\\r', 'silent', '\\r', '\\r', 'The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my\\r', 'dear: she is only a child', '”\\r', '\\r', 'The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn\\r', 'them over', '”\\r', '\\r', 'The Knave did so, very carefully,

hedgehog\\r', 'had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all\\r', 'this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\\r', 'wanted to send the hedgehog to,

'\\r', 'The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\\r', 'all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time\\r', 'the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\\r', 'shouting “Off with his head', '” or “Off with her head', '” about once in a\\r', 'minute', '\\r', '\\r', 'Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\\r', 'dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\\r', '“and then,” thought she, “what would become of me', ' They’re dreadfully\\r', 'fond of beheading people

the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\\r', 'to', '”\\r', '\\r', '“How are you getting on', '” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\\r', 'enough for it to speak with', '\\r', '\\r',

turns, and she did not like the look\\r', 'of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\\r', 'whether it was her turn or not', ' So she went in search of her hedgehog', '\\r', '\\r', 'The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\\r', 'to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\\r', 'other: the only difficulty was,

'\\r', '\\r', 'The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\\r', 'beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense', '\\r', '\\r', 'The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t

accidentally upset the week before', '\\r', '\\r', '“Oh, I _beg_ your pardon', '” she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\\r', 'began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the

mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\\r', 'court', '\\r', '\\r', '“What do you know about this business', '” the King said to Alice', '\\r', '\\r', '“Nothing,” said Alice', '\\r', '\\r',

'At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\\r', 'her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\\r', 'tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\\r', 'head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\\r', 'leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face', '\\r', '\\r', '“Wake up, Alice dear', '” said her sister; “Why, what a long sleep you’ve\\r', 'had', '”\\r', '\\r', '“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream', '” said Alice, and she told her\\r', 'sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\\r', 'Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\\r', 'had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, “It _was_ a curious\\r', 'dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late', '”\\r', 'So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\\r', 'what a wonderful dream it had been', '\\r', '\\r', '\\r', 'But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\\r', 'hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all\\r', 'her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion,\\r', 'and this was her dream:—\\r', '\\r', 'First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\\r', 'hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were\\r', 'looking up into hers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and\\r', 'see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair\\r', 'that _would_ always get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or\\r', 'seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the\\r', 'strange creatures of her little sister’s dream', '\\r', '\\r', 'The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—the\\r', 'frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she\\r', 'could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\\r', 'shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\\r', 'ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby\\r', 'was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\\r', 'around it—once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\\r', 'Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\\r', 'filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\\r', 'Turtle', '\\r', '\\r', 'So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\\r', 'Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\\r', 'would change to dull reality—the grass would be only rustling in the\\r', 'wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling\\r', 'teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\\r', 'cries to the voice of the shepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the\\r', 'shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change\\r', '(she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the\\r', 'lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock\\r', 'Turtle’s heavy sobs', '\\r', '\\r', 'Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\\r', 'would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\\r', 'keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\\r', 'childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children,\\r', 'and make _their_ eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale,\\r', 'perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she\\r', 'would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all\\r', 'their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer\\r', 'days', '\\r', '\\r', 'THE END\\r', '\\r', '\\r', '']\n"
