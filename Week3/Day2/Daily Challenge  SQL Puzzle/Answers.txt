NULL

Q1. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?:
 SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft 
    WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NULL )

A1: This statement will count a number of rows in FirstTab, but only rows which has not id = NULL. So:
Output:

5   Pawan
6   Sharlee
7   Krish

Q2. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?

    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft 
    WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id = 5 )

A2. The same poin as in Q1 but here we will get a row without id == 5
Output: 2 :
ID  Name
6   Sharlee
7   Krish

Q4. What will be the OUTPUT of the following statement?

    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM FirstTab AS ft 
    WHERE ft.id NOT IN ( SELECT id FROM SecondTab WHERE id IS NOT NULL )

A4. Output:2 the same as in Q2
